# Employee Tracker

## Description
This project uses inquirer, Node.js and MySQL to create a command-line application that generates prompts to view and manipulate the locally stored employee database. Which displays data related to employee, department, role, salary and manager.
This system is referred to as a "content management system" or
(CMS).

## Installation
To install this generator a user could clone the repo to their vscode terminal then open an integrated terminal in the index.js file. Then type npm i, and hit enter. Then type node server.js, and hit enter.

## Usage
To use this application. After following the installation instructions just type a title name
for your note, then in the text area type the details of the note you want to create, then hit the
new note button and your note and title will be saved in the sidebar. The note titles in the sidebar can be 
clicked on to view the text details and edit or delete the selected note.

## Credits
I did not have any collaberation on this project other than my tutor Trinh Nguyen, who helped me with the syntax for the queries. She also reminded me to keep the MVP in mind and maybe adjust my scope a bit, as I originally had a lot of prompts that definately were not required. I just got a little carried away on the data that could be saved and accessed. The rest of the code in this app came from our class activities and the code that is in them, which I used as templates for this challenge.
